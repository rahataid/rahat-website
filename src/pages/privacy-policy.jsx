                <p style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>
                    We implement robust security measures to protect personal
                    data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
                    destruction. Our security practices include:

                        <strong>Access Control:</strong> We enforce strict
                        access control policies to ensure that only authorised
                        personnel can access sensitive data. This includes
                        role-based access controls and multi-factor
                        authentication to verify user identities.

                        <strong>Network Security:</strong> Our network security
                        measures include firewalls and secure VPNs to protect
                        against unauthorised access and cyber attacks.

                        <strong>Data Integrity:</strong> We implement measures
                        to ensure the integrity of the data stored in our
                        PostgreSQL database. This includes the use of
                        comprehensive audit trails to monitor and record all
                        data access and modifications, ensuring transparency and
                        accountability.

                        <strong>Encryption:</strong> We ensure that our database
                        is encrypted, providing an additional layer of security
                        to protect sensitive information. Additionally, we use
                        data masking techniques for Personally Identifiable
                        Information (PII) to ensure that sensitive data is
                        obscured during processing and storage.

                        system and network activities. This approach helps us
                        identify and respond to security threats promptly by
                        reviewing logs for any unusual or suspicious activities,
                        ensuring ongoing protection for sensitive data.

                        and third-party partners to ensure that they comply with

                        staff to educate them about security best practices,
